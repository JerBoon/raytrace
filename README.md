# raytrace
A ray tracing package using R

It's still very much a work in progress at this stage, but I've implemented at least *some* elements of ray tracing so far..

Don't worry too much about the code at the moment. I need to restructure it somewhat yet..

Uses my **vecspace** and (optionally) **vecshapes** packages to define the basic geometry of the world.
